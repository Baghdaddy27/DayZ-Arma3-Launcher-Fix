# DayZ-Arma3-Launcher-Fix

Version 1.2

🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide to Fix the corrupt mod issues on the DayZ and ARMA 3 launchers. I used GE-Proton9-23 but some people have told me experimental works. 


📌 Step 1: Download the fix_dayz.sh  and/or  fix_arma3.sh scripts and place them in your home directory. 

📌 Step 2: Make the Script Executable with  chmod +x fix_dayz.sh  and /or  chmod +x fix_arma3.sh

📌 Step 3: Run the Script ./fix_dayz.sh  or  ./fix_arma3.sh


NOTE: Sometimes the mods will become corrupted especially if the game was updated, the proton version was changed, or a file verification was run. Just go into the prefix c drive and delete all the mods and any shortcuts and then re-download them. You can then run the script again.
